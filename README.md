Crop health is a critical determinant of food security, especially in developing regions where staple
crops like maize, sorghum, and rice serve as primary nutrition sources. However, fungal diseases
continue to threaten these crops, leading to significant yield losses. Traditional disease detection
methods are largely manual and prone to inaccuracies, prompting the need for automated, scalable
solutions. This study explores the application of lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
accurate and efficient classification of fungal diseases in crop leaves. Five pre-trained lightweight
CNN architectures—VGG16, MobileNetV3, DenseNet121, NasNetMobile, and EfficientNetB2 were
evaluated using a curated dataset of diseased and healthy leaf images. The models were assessed
based on classification accuracy, computational efficiency, model size, and suitability for deployment
in low-resource environments. Experimental results showed that EfficientNetB2 consistently outperformed other models in accuracy
across all three crops, with MobileNetV3 providing a viable alternative for edge-device deployment
due to its minimal memory footprint and low inference time. This research demonstrates the
feasibility of deploying lightweight CNNs for early disease detection, supporting the advancement of
precision agriculture in resource-constrained settings.
